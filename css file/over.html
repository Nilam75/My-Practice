    <p>Chandrayaan-3 is the third lunar exploration mission by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).[7] It
        consists of a lander and the Pragyan rover similar to Chandrayaan-2, but does not have an orbiter. Its
        propulsion module behaves like a communication relay satellite. The propulsion module carries the lander and
        rover configuration until the spacecraft is in a 100 km lunar orbit.[8][9]

        Following Chandrayaan-2, where a last-minute glitch in the landing guidance software led to the lander crashing
        after entering lunar orbit, another lunar mission was proposed.[10]

        The launch of Chandrayaan-3 took place at 14 July 2023, at 2:35 pm IST[11] and lunar injection of 100 km
        circular polar orbit was completed successfully as part of phase one.[2][12] The lander and rover is expected to
        land near the lunar south pole region on 23 August 2023.[13]</p>
